# Dantcho - Personal Website Design

This is the second version of the initial design for my personal website. This version only contains pages for the blog and projects.

To compile CSS:

Run: `npm install`

Then use the "Run Task" in VS Code to run "gulp: default". This will compile the CSS every time there is a change in any `.less` file in the `[PROJECT_ROOT]\less` folder.

Alternativly compile `less\style.less` into `css\style.css` manually.
